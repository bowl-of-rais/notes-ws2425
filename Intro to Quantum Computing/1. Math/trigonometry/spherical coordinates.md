generalization of [[polar coordinates]]

used to specify a point in space with
- **radial distance** $r$, distance from origin
- **polar angle** $\theta$ between radial line and the polar axis
- **azimuthal angle** $\varphi$ of rotation around polar axis

there are a bunch of different names for the angles

NOTE: the polar axis needs to be defined. typically $z$. perpendicular to the so-called reference plane or fundamental plane.
