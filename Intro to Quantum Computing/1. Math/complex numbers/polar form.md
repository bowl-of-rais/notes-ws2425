>[!info] a different 2d representation for [[complex numbers]]

for complex number $z$ with absolute value $r$ and argument $\varphi$: $$z = r(\cos \varphi + i \sin \varphi)$$which is equivalent to $$z = r e^{i \varphi}$$bc of [[Euler's formula]].

>This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function $e^{i \varphi}$ is a [unit complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_complex_number "Unit complex number"), i.e., it traces out the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane") as $\varphi$ ranges through the real numbers.

NOTE: different phases can represent the same complex number, e.g. $\varphi = 2\pi$ and $\varphi = 4 \pi$.
