>[!prob] for generalizing linear algebra/calculus from Euclidean to possibly infinite-dimensional vector spaces

formally:
- a vector space
- with an inner product that induces a distance function for which the space is a complete metric space[^1]

this is because we use [[complex numbers]] (Euclidean spaces are defined over $\mathbb{R}$)

[^1]: A metric space (set + notion of distance) M is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in M has a limit also in M. Intuitively: "no points missing".
