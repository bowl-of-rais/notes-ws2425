represents some transformation $T$ in matrix form: $$T(x) = Ax$$
### Properties

- can be composed via [[matrix multiplication]]
- inverse operations are given by $A^{-1}$ if $A$ is invertible

### Examples (geometric transformations)

- stretch
- squeeze
- [rotation](rotational%20matrix.md)
- shear
- reflect
- project
