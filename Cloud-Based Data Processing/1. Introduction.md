>[!goal] how to design scalable and efficient cloud-native systems

>[!goal] build cloud-native multi-tier data processing systems

# Motivation

### Why clouds?

- cloud heavily used nowadays -> fast dissemination of new technologies
- cloud providers control full stack: hardware, software, programming, applications design
- unpredictable hardware faults -> software must be designed with that expectation

>[!goal] design based on service-level objectives (SLOs)
>- performance/latency, availability, efficiency, elasticity
>- basis for service-level agreements (SLAs)

aspects apart from scalability:
- costs
- privacy, security

### Why data-processing?

- biiiiiiiiiiig data collected everywhere, dominant workload
