>[!star] applies textual transformation before compilation

>[!imp] macros are usually best avoided

# `#include`

>[!goal] textual inclusion, copy paste style

```cpp
#include "file"
```

- searches current directory -> include path -> system path
- convention: files **in current project**

 ```cpp
 #include <file>
 ```

- searches include path -> system path
- convention: **libraries** and **system includes**

##### About the include path

```bash
-I <directory>
```
adds directory to include path

```cpp
target_include_directories(target PUBLIC src/)
```
in cmake

NOTE: usually, project root is added to include path -> easier to include other files

-----
# `#define`

>[!goal] named macro with optional textual replacement, can be undefined with `#undef`

```cpp fold title:"Example: Cursed macro usage"
#define EMPTY
#define return never
#define ANSWER 42
#define FUNC_DECL int getAnswer()
#undef return
FUNC_DECL { EMPTY return ANSWER; EMPTY }
// Preprocessed to:
// int getAnswer() { return 42; }
```

>[!imp] re-defining keywords is UB if standard library is included

-----
# Pre-defined macros
by compiler

- standardized or (more commonly) varying between compilers
##### Examples
- `__cplusplus`: what standard is used
- `__FILE__`: name of current dile
- `__x86_64__`: defined if compiling for x86-64

##### Compiler flag
for defining macros with optional expansion

```bash
-D<macroname>=<expansion>
```

-----
# Condition

>[!goal] to conditionally compile parts of code

-> useful for architecture-dependent code or debug builds

```cpp fold title: Conditional macros
#if <expr>
#else
#endif

// alternatives
#elif <expr>
#ifdef <macro>
#ifndef <macro>
```

- definition can be tested via `{cpp}defined(MACRO)`
- expressions *only* operate on macros
##### To fail compilation

```cpp
#error <error message>
```
##### To make nested comments

```cpp
#if 0
fun commented stuff!
#if 0
comment at more depth! omg!
#endif
#endif
```
# Function-like macros

>[!goal] macros can have arguments

>[!imp] due to the replacement being purely textual, take extra care with precedence and put parentheses around parameters

```cpp fold title:"Example: Cursed 3-way min"
#define MIN(a,b) ((a)<(b)?(a):(b))

int min3(int a, int b, int c) {
// Preprocessed to:
// return ((((a)<(b)?(a):(b)))<(c)?(((a)<(b)?(a):(b))):(c));
	return MIN(MIN(a, b), c);
}
```

# `assert(expr)`

>[!goal] aborts program if assertion is false

- implemented as preprocessor macro
- is removed when `{cpp}NDEBUG` is defined
