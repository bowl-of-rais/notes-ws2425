### Double-slit experiment

> **wave-particle duality**: all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties

- the larger the object the less wavy (smaller wavelength)
- connection to QC: we model quantum state as wave functions $$\vert\psi\rangle = \alpha \vert 0\rangle  + \beta \vert 1\rangle $$with amplitudes $\alpha$, $\beta$
- **wave function collapse**: measuring forces particles to "choose" a slit

### Delayed-choice quantum eraser

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser#The_experiment_of_Kim_et_al._(1999))

- copies particles -> entanglement between original + copy
