>[!info] for a [[vector space]] $V$, the (algebraic) dual space $V^{*}$ is the set of all linear maps $\varphi : V \to F$

>the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is [anti-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiisomorphic "Antiisomorphic") to the original space

NOTE: think of multiplications as linear maps
