>[!info] for $z = a + bi$, the complex conjugate is $z^{*} = a - bi$

## Properties

- distributive over addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- real numbers are fixed points
- involution: $z^{**} = z$
- product of number with conjugate is square of [modulus](norm.md): $zz^{*} = |z|^{2}$ and also a real number: $a^{2} + b^{2}$ (or $r^{2}$ in polar)
- polar form: $(re^{i\varphi})^* = re^{-i\varphi}$
