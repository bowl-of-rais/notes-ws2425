> physical facility that enterprises use to house computing and storage infrastructure in a variety of networked formats

- [ ] TODO make flashcards lecture 2 ðŸ“… 2024-10-31 

**geography**:
- to meet data residency requirements (laws, latency, etc)
- data residency boundary
- redundancy via multiple *regions*

**region**:
- multiple data centers within a metropolitan area
- network latency between regions should be <2ms

**availability zones**:
- unique physical locations
- one or multiple DCs

-> hierarchy to ensure fault tolerance

## Costs for operating a data center

- high electricity consumption, greenhouse gas emissions

>**PUE**: energy used by facility / energy delivered to computing equipment

can be increased via
- location (power/cooling)
- raising temperature
- reduce energy conversion (voltages)
- extreme environments
- reuse heat

from PUE 2 ~20 years ago to 1.1

-> inverse of data center infrastructure efficiency

**total facility power**: IT systems (hot) + other equipment (flop)

## Challenges

1. Cooling
2. Energy Proportional Computing
	- energy consumption not proportional to load
	- CPUs are hungwy
	-> optimizing workloads: virtualization, consolidation
3. Idle servers
	- non-virtualized servers are idle 6-15% of the time
	-> resource pooling/virtualization, application/server consolidation
4. Efficient monitoring
	- monitoring + cluster management needed to check on resource utilization
5. scale/growth
6. networking at scale
	- **software defined networking**: 
		> **Software-defined networking** (**SDN**) is an approach to [network management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_management "Network management") that uses abstraction to enable dynamic and programmatically efficient network configuration to create grouping and segmentation while improving network performance and monitoring in a manner more akin to [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing") than to traditional network management.
