#### Scalability

>[!info] how to get more

- ideally: linear
- load imbalances: depends also on data distribution
- [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)
- stragglers
- synchronization overhead
-> partition both data and computation

how to scale?
- **task-parallel** or **data-parallel**

#### Fault tolerance

>[!info] anticipate hw/sw failures

- design for *fast* recovery
- **failure recovery**: via {repl|white} **replication**/redundancy or **re-computation** depending on context

#### High availability

- downtimes: bad customer experience, loss in revenue
- regulated by contract
- "number of nines"

important points:
- single points of failure are evil
- crossovers need to be reliable
- monitor and detect failures!

#### {repl} Consistency

>[!info] redundancy necessary for reliability/availability/low latency

- [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) (depends on definition of terms, but still was relevant in practice)
- **eventual consistency**
- stronger guarantees today
#### Performance

>[!info] good user experience: low latency, high throughput

- users are impatient, so latency costs money
- **tail latency**: average don't say much with big numbers -> focus on last $0.X\%$ of request latency distribution graph
	- amplified by scale (fan-outs, probabilities :'D)
