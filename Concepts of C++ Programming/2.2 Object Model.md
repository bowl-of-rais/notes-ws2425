# Memory model

- bytes make up contiguous sequence(s) of bytes
- bytes have unique addresses

# Objects
= region of storage

properties:
- size
- alignment
- storage duration
- lifetime
- type
- value
- optionally: name

can be:
- created
- destroyed
- referred to
- accessed
- manipulated

## Object size and alignment

>[!info] defined by type

- `{cpp} sizeof` operator: size in bytes
- `{cpp} alignof` operator: alignment
	- meaning: address must be a multiple of alignment (depends on implementation)

### Storage duration

| Type of duration | Begin         | End            | Example                  | Notes                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| automatic        | scope begin   | scope end      | local variables          |                                                           |
| static           | program begin | program end    | global variables         | allocated/initialized before `main`, order not guaranteed |
| thread           | thread start  | thread end     | `thread_local` variables | 1 copy per thread                                         |
| dynamic          | `{cpp} new`   | `{cpp} delete` |                          | must allocate/deallocate manually                         |
### Lifetime

>[!info] from full initialization until destructor call (classes) or storage deallocation/reuse (others)

- never exceeds storage duration

>[!imp] BEWARE: using object outside lifetime is UB
